Theming With SASS Demo Repo
===========================

This repository is a companion to the [Theming Sites with SASS](http://www.slideshare.net/shawnrider/theming-sites-with-sass) presentation.

The goal of this repo is to provide some examples and an experimental space for trying out the concepts discussed in the presentation.

Installation
------------

To use this repo, you need to have a working Node.js environment with Yeoman, Bower, and Gulp installed globally.

You can find Node.js at [http://nodejs.org](http://nodejs.org). (Mac users should install Node via Homebrew for an easier time: [http://brew.sh/](http://brew.sh/).)

Install Yeoman, Bower and Gulp:

`npm install -g yo, bower, gulp-cli`

Once you have the base dependencies installed you can clone this repo. From the root of the repo, install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

And when that finishes:

`bower install`

Once those installations have completed, you should be able to run the development server:

`gulp serve`

That command should open a web browser window with your site running locally. Now you can dig into the files and start experimenting with the setup.
